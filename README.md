# Visual_Content_Narration_System-python
Visual Content Narration System is automatically generate captions for images.
It including preprocessing the image, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for generating captions. 

Python Libraries:
    TensorFlow or PyTorch (In this project i use TensorFlow)
    Numpy
    OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
    Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing
